|BiomeDef.description=The surface is covered with sheets of ice which can be kilometers thick. No soil, no plants. The only animals here are migrating to somewhere else - or badly lost. Snow slows down travel, but there are ice sheets that provide smooth walking.
|BiomeDef.description.zh-cn=这个地区的地表被几千米厚的冰层覆盖着，这里没有土地，没有植物。这里的动物不是迁移到别的地方了就是在恶劣环境下灭绝了。积雪使得出行变得缓慢，但有冰盖可以提供平坦的路面。
