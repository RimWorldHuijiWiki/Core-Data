|ResearchProjectDef.description=Allows the construction of long-range mineral scanners which automatically detect precious minerals like gold or jade in the nearby areas (but not in which the scanners were built).<br/><br/>The lumps are found on average once per 30 days within a radius of 30 tiles.<br/><br/>Building more than one scanner in the same or nearby areas has little to no effect.
