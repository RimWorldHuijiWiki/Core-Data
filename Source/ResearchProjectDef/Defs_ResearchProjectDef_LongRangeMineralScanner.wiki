|ResearchProjectDef.description=Allows the construction of long-range mineral scanners which automatically detect precious minerals like gold or jade in the nearby areas (but not in which the scanners were built).<br/><br/>The lumps are found on average once per 30 days within a radius of 30 tiles.<br/><br/>Building more than one scanner in the same or nearby areas has little to no effect.
|ResearchProjectDef.description.zh-cn=解锁建造「远距离矿物扫描仪」，可自动探测附近区域（非扫描仪所在区域）的珍惜矿物，比如黄金或翡翠。<br/><br/>半径30格地图内，发现矿物块的频率为平均每30天一次。<br/><br/>在同一区域内或临近区域建造多于一个扫描仪对效率影响不大。
